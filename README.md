Script for *The Environmental Neuroactive Chemicals List of Prioritized Substances for Human Biomonitoring and Neurotoxicity Testing: A Database and High-Throughput Toxicokinetics Approach*

This study set out to “ENRICH” chemical analyses of human biological samples and ongoing toxicity testing by developing a neuroactive chemicals screening library to more efficiently measure environmental substances likely impacting brain development and function; and thus, develop the **E**nvironmental **N**eu**R**oact**I**ve **CH**emicals (ENRICH) list of prioritized chemicals, with an emphasis on childhood-relevant exposures. Specifically, a suite of in silico database mining approaches were used to integrate metrics informing likelihood of neuroactivity, exposure, detection in biological samples, and experimental feasibility, followed by high-throuhgput toxicokinetic modeling to inform the likelihood of each chemical reaching urine.

**Experiment_1**- Dataset aggregation, filtering, and ranking to identify set of 1,827 chemicals for further examination, including 250 priority “ENRICH” chemicals.

**Experiment_2**- High-throughput toxicokinetic analysis of chemicals identified in **Experiment_1** to investigate which substances reach urine. Additionally, an empirical decision tree of toxicokinetic parameters is generated to bin chemicals based on an estimated fraction of the parent compound excreted.

**Experiment_3**- Investigation into human use profiles of the 250 ENRICH chemicals.
